# Open Access

Digital technology is changing the way by which the academic community disseminates scholarship. New Internet based publishing models offer opportunities to increase access and enhance the availability of research results to scholars and the broader general public. Open Access publishing, Institutional Repositories, and a burgeoning list of peer-reviewed online journals are just a few examples of new publishing options available to scholars.

## Open Access Publishing

The aim of open access scholarly publishing is to make high quality, peer-reviewed scholarly content available freely on the web. A common misconception about open access as a publishing model is that anyone may post what he or she likes on the Internet. In fact, scholarly open access journals apply rigorous peer review to their content. The "open" refers to the free availability of research to the public, not to the removal of the refereeing process that has long been the basis of scholarly publishing. Open access is in every way compatible with rigorous peer review.

## Creative Commons

Another strategy for retaining and assigning your copyright is to publish your work under a [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/) license. These licenses allow authors to retain the copyright to their work, and can be used to set the terms and conditions by which others may use the work. Some publishers are satisfied with the rights that authors license to them through Creative Commons and will agree to publish your work under some of the Creative Commons [license options](http://creativecommons.org/choose/).
