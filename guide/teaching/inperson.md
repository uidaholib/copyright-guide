# Face-to-Face Instruction

"Face-to-face instruction," as the phrase suggests, is when an instructor and students at a non-profit educational institution are together in a single place devoted to instruction, and where the teaching and learning takes place at the same time. In this setting all performances and displays of a work are allowed, provided that all the materials are legally acquired.

If the use occurs outside the classroom, then you can still fall back upon [fair use](#whatisfairuse) as an option. However, [permission](#permission) will be required if neither fair use nor the [educational exception](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#110) pertains.

## Choosing Materials

Many materials are available to use free of charge. If you want to use digital materials such as text, images, audio and film clips, start by looking for sources that don't require special permission. These may include:

- materials you created yourself, and for which you hold the copyright;
- materials that are in the [public domain](#public), either because the creator has waived their exclusive rights, they were created by the [federal government](#docs), or because they are [sufficiently old](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm) and so their rights have now lapsed;
- materials that have been made available by the creator under a license that allows for the kind of use you want to make (for example, a [Creative Commons license](#openaccess));
- materials that are publicly available on the Internet, to which you may link (as opposed to copying the files and reposting them elsewhere); or
- content found on one of the U of I Libraries' many licensed [electronic databases](#licensed) (e.g. EBSCO, JSTOR, HeinOnline, Web of Science, etc.)
