## Licensed Electronic Resources

Contractual license agreements and copyright law govern the access, use, and reproduction of most of the U of I Libraries' electronic databases. Users of library-licensed resources must comply with the terms of these agreements by a) limiting their uses to non-commercial, educational, or personal research purposes; and b) not facilitating unauthorized access by others outside of the University community.

For a more comprehensive list of policies regarding electronic database licenses at the University of Idaho Library, see their [Conditions of Use and Licensing Restrictions for Electronic Resources](http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/find/agreement.html).
